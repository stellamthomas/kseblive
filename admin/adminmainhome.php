KSEB follows a slab system in which a consumer using up to 250 units per month will have a telescopic tariff. This means that the first
 50 units will be charged at a lower rate, with the rates increasing progressively for subsequent 50 units. After 250 units, the billing will be ‘non-telescopic’,
which means the slab rate will be applicable for the entire electricity consumed.[3] The following table shows the electricity tariff for domestic consumers</h4>
